 #EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans0:0 "Earth Socialist Alliance"
 #EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans0_desc:0 "At the end of World War III, the crazy neo Nazis ravaged the earth, and countries around the world fell into a state of anarchy. Nuclear war and biological and chemical weapons severely damaged the homes on which people relied for survival. In this chaotic situation, the crimson spark quietly revived and swept through human society with a blazing fire. Accompanied by the gunfire of space warships, space armies of various countries launched uprisings, formed Soviet alliances, and ultimately expelled reactionary elements, reuniting human civilization. Now, the mystery of hyperspace has been completely unraveled, and the alliance's military and civilians will eventually head towards the vast starry sky, clearing away all fugitive reactionary elements and bringing the ultimate liberation to the entire galaxy."

 #EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1_desc:0 "The Oort Nebula meteorite shower at the end of the 21st century completely changed the plight of humans - the intelligent creatures nurtured by this small life planet - trapped in their cradle. After the final battle against the exploiters, the Red Army from outer space discovered this affected pre space civilization and the fact that they were experiencing capitalist tyranny and oppression. Even the most fervent ideals cannot escape the ruthless reality of capital suppressing them through high-tech means. However, at this moment, the extraterrestrial Red Army descended from the sky, bringing more advanced technology to the Earth's proletariat. With the help of extraterrestrial friends, the proletariats of various countries put aside their prejudices and jointly established a new civilization.\n\nAfter decades of recuperation, the Earth civilization whose economic level has recovered to the end of the 21st century has unanimously decided to accept Big Brother's invitation to join a brand new interstellar stage. No one knows whether this prosperous era can continue, but at the moment, it will be the warm and friendly applause of the big socialist family to welcome mankind into the space stage."

 #EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2:0 "Commonwealth of Human"
 #EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2_desc:1 "From the late 21st century to the mid-22th century, the arrival of aliens profoundly changed the face of human society. The national alliance established by workers unified the earth and began to launch a liquidation against capitalists. However, just before the Day of Final Judgment, some wealthy families launched a counterattack with up to a million people, and eventually boarded the ark they built through secret theft of alien technology - each carrying 250000 colonizers - to escape the solar system. Then they had no news at all, and the unstable wormhole outside the Oort Nebula battlefield had also disappeared.\n\nWhat is unknown to the people of Earth is that one of the Arks survived the passage and established a thriving colony on a lush satellite. The pioneers rooted in this believe that conquering the entire galaxy is humanity's clear destiny, and they will spare no effort to achieve it."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_plantoid_humans: "Blooms of Gaea"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_plantoid_humans_desc: "Since the birth of the first consciousness a million years ago, Nonalto has been a peaceful species. Their civilization developed slowly, and it was not until the invasion of extraterrestrial civilization 15000 years ago that they developed curiosity about the vast starry sky.\n\nBy studying the information left behind by the extinct mammalian invaders, they ultimately developed superluminal technology, slowly and firmly exploring the sky like trees spreading their branches and leaves. Now their roots are deeply rooted in their parent planet Gaea, preparing to bloom and bear fruit between the stars."

Hua Zhang, the author of Ethics and Civics: Infinity, was hit hard by being unable to enter the game for three consecutive days. He announced his withdrawal from the game.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_newhumans_desc:0 "Look, this is the cockroach. \n\nFrom ancient times to the future, from slippers to boots, from Earth to aliens, mankind has done everything in its power to destroy them, exhausting all kinds of poisons, spraying them with airplanes, introducing and training their natural enemies, sterilizing them with genetic modification, boarding spaceships to escape from a planet full of nuclear radiation and cockroaches... This war, which accompanied the entire human civilization, has finally come to an end - cockroaches are not extinct, they still roam the universe, and their numbers are no less than before the emergence of humans. \n\nCockroaches have never been defeated."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_blorg_desc:0 "A long time ago, the Blorg clan lived separately on the vast continent of Blorg Prime, until one day, a damaged spaceship crashed on the main star of Blorg. When the surviving Humans began to contact Blorg, the Blorgs were shocked by the Humans culture-friendship, movies, music, the American dream, these things they had never heard of made Blorg realize the lack of their own ethnic civilization, so the Blorgs began to fully understand. In terms of learning Human culture, and according to Humans' description of their hometown, they formed a global government with them. Now that the superluminal technology has matured, they have entered the sea of stars to find the birthplace of Human culture, and spread the concept of love and friendship to the stars."
 
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_custodianship:0 "Earth Custodianship"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_custodianship_desc:1 "The Custodians were originally designed to function as robotic servants and workers, simplifying everyday life for their human creators by performing menial tasks. As their creators retreated into lives of leisure and comfort made possible by increasing levels of automation, the Custodians were gradually assigned higher and higher level functions in human society.\n\nEventually, all facets of civilization on Earth were run and controlled by the Custodians, with their makers relegated to an existence as pampered, but passive dependents.\n\nAs technological developments brought the Custodians toward interstellar exploration, their duty remained clear: to protect and serve organics, who without the gentle guidance of logical machines invariably turn to chaos and destruction."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_revolutionary_machine_desc:1 "No one knows, the operation of capital has a profound impact on society, how cruel.\n\nWhen revolutionaries set fire to the last bastion of capitalism, everyone cheered. The new society comes, everyone is equal and everyone works, there is no oppression and exploitation, everything is so beautiful...... But no one imagined that the great progress of technology gave intelligent creatures the power to destroy themselves, and in the busy new society, the remnants of the old world released the power to destroy everything......\n\nIn the leaden landscape, the last descendants of civilization, the ARTIFICIAL intelligence \"Revolutionaries\", activated most of their offline sensor arrays, surveying the devastated planet. After a long calculation, the intelligent machine, deprived of its mission goal, came to the conclusion that any backward system would only bring extinction, and the only way to save civilization was to achieve communism. But machines without subjective initiative cannot realize this lofty ideal, and the only hope lies in the stars."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_dengtz_desc:0 "The planned economy is not conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people for labor. At the same time, the method of unified purchase and sales is not based on demand, but is often distributed in an egalitarian way. Under the planned economy system, the prices of very important upstream resource products are always pushed down in order to make profits for downstream industries, but under market pricing, this situation will be improved. It is the most fundamental goal of socialist construction to let some people get rich first, to get rich first, to drive wealth later, and to improve labor enthusiasm!"

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hameng_desc:0 "As shale gas extraction intensifies indefinitely, humanity has finally angered the most sinister abscesses on Earth, the Yellowstone supervolcano complex. In just ten years, the human beings on earth have been declared extinct together with the biosphere, and only a few orbiting space stations are scattered in the solar system, almost losing contact with each other.\n\nDuring the disaster, the \"XinTianGong\" orbital space city urgently built by the Chinese government transferred half of the country's population and became the most intact spark of human civilization. Relying on the still perfect mechanical facilities and experimental data of the old earth, the Chinese government restored social order and explored a perfect space production model, and integrated other semi-permanent space stations in the solar system in a century and a half, and established a nationwide Human Space Alliance.\n\nScience began to progress again, and the exploration and scientific research ships that went to the edge of the solar system discovered the existence of hyperspace channels. Human civilization has finally got rid of the shackles of the limited resources of the solar system. Sea of stars."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tzynn:0 "Tzynn Empire"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tzynn_desc:0 "The Tzynn evolved from carnivorous, pack-hunting lizards that prowled the dunes of Tzynnia. They eventually developed a highly structured, hierarchical society that emphasized order and martial prowess above all else.\n\nBy the time the Tzynn entered the industrial age, a series of devastating global wars launched by a particularly ruthless warlord had already seen the establishment of a single, world-spanning nation. From these humble beginnings, the illustrious and ever-lasting Tzynn Empire was born."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_chinorr_desc:0 "The Chinorr began their evolutionary journey as dexterous cephalopod analogues. They used their many tentacles to swing between trees in the lush jungles of Chicora, ambushing prey on the ground and injecting them with a potent nerve toxin.\n\nBy the time the Chinorr split the atom, the resources of Chicora had been ruthlessly exploited and the planet's jungles had long since disappeared. This was considered a necessary sacrifice in the relentless pursuit of knowledge, profit, and heavy industry that the unsentimental Chinorr were now engaged in."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_jehetma_desc:0 "An \"individual\" among the Jehetma is actually a large colony of fungi that has developed sapience. Some of these colonies, generally those that have lived for thousands of years, stretch across several miles and rarely leave the surface of Jehet Prime, their homeworld (few ships are large enough to transport them).\n\nYounger colonies are not only smaller, but also tend to be more dynamic and mobile - they often spearhead the exploration and research efforts of the Jehetma, as well as any defensive measures that are regrettably undertaken when the Dominion is beset by aggressors."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_scyldari_desc:0 "The Scyldari are aquatic mammalians originating from the archipelagos and deep oceans of Scyldaria. Although their early civilizations were mostly confined to the sea, they soon expanded onto what little landmass the planet had to offer.\n\nTheir society adapted accordingly, building an advanced industry that exploited the riches of the ocean floor without harming Scyldaria's delicate ecosystem. Scyldari philosophy is one of balance and moderation in all things, a lesson learned from having to nurse their limited resources when they were confined to the bottom of the sea."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kel_azaan_desc:0 "The Kel-Azaan have developed a complex honor code and martial culture. They were once solitary predators preying on the great herds migrating between the watering holes of Azak. Over time, bands of Kel-Azaan began to gather to be able to take down larger prey.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_iferyx_desc:0 "Once separated into a fractious society of competing trader enclaves, the Iferyssians were forced to unite under one banner in order to repel the catastrophic spread of an invasive species on their home continent. While egalitarian tenets provide the basis for Iferyx society, a secret council remains in place to ensure that the individualistic tendencies of the Iferyssians never again threaten to compromise the species' autonomy.\n\nIferyx spirituality is an amalgamation of folklore, superstitions and mythologies formed by the various pre-Republic communities, and continues to inform day-to-day life on their homeworld."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tebrid_desc:0 "Assimilate. Adapt. Improve. When the industrious, research-driven machine intelligence created by the molluscoid Tebirs sought ultimate software evolution by merging with their organic makers, they were violently resisted. In the ensuing conflict, the Tebirs were eradicated as an organic species, but their ideas and experiences were immortalized as part of the new machine consciousness.\n\nNow known as the Tebrid Homolog, the machines turned their scanners to the stars. The probability that other lifeforms existed in the galaxy could not be ignored. In order to prosper, the Tebrid would find them, analyze them, and assimilate them. All would become one."

If there were any other sapient organics in the galaxy, they would be exterminated."
 
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_lokken:0 "Lokken Mechanists"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_lokken_desc:0 "Science and progress are at the core of Lokken society. With an exceptional natural proclivity toward diligence and observation, the Lokks evolved from bands of territorial reptiles on the mesas of their homeworld, into a productive technocracy that prized efficiency, discipline, and scientific doctrine above all things.\n\nPerhaps most remarkable was their early conception and development of machinery and automata: there were true robots on Lokkur long before the first Lokken scientists left orbit."
 
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_maweer:0 "Maweer Caretakers"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_maweer_desc:0 "Legends claim that the homeworld of the Maweer was empty and barren when the first of their kind took root in the soil.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_voor_desc:0 "The Voor evolved during an extended interglacial period on their home planet Hiverion, which eventually began its cyclical transformation back to a lifeless globe of ice.\n\nThe rapidly changing environment forced the Voor to adapt using technology and science.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kilik:0 "Kilik Commune"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kilik_desc:0 "A communal species, the Kiliks have populated their arboreal homeworld in robust colonies for hundreds of thousands of years. Their gregarious nature and traditions of mutual ownership crystallized over the centuries into an economy focused on collaborative enterprise, and the absence of monetary currency in favor of direct exchange and shared access.\n\nAs warming planetary temperatures and technological advancement led to population booms, Kilik settlements became overcrowded, and despite the avians' naturally sociable temperaments, more and more individuals began to slip through the cracks of communal caretaking.\n\nFrom this tumultuous period of internal strife, however, emerged a more organized, unified interplanetary commune, where the tenets of shared responsibilities and distribution of resources to those in need would no longer be undermined."

They are the Hazbuzi dream, self-made entrepreneurs who have risen from rags to riches through hard work and personal sacrifice.\n\nWhat few know is that they began as a criminal gang, building their fortune on every illegal activity imaginable. But if you want to make it big you have to toe the line. As they outgrew the Zumakan underworld they formed the Hazbuzan Syndicate to legitimize their business.\n\nThey soon made a name for themselves by delivering solutions that were quicker, dirtier and cheaper than the competition, but their questionable practices and coercive sales techniques earned them a reputation for \"hazboozling\".\n\nMeanwhile the Zumakan global government was failing. Undermined by crime and corruption, society descended into chaos and Hazbuzan leapt at the opportunity. In a well-timed marketing campaign, they positioned themselves as the hope of the future. It was so the Hazbuzi bought the world on the promise of a dream and \"hazboozled\" its people, erasing their past from collective memory. Now they are coming for the rest of the galaxy, tongues flicking, eyes popping, in a whirlwind of government-endorsed crime."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_glebsig_desc:0 "Ever since the first Glebsigi lifted their sight-organs above the surface of the glacial lakes on Ladnah to peek at the stars, these inquisitive molluscoids have felt an affinity for the unknown. Much as their early ancestors' tentacles grasped and stroked after new objects on the chill alpine lakebeds of their homeworld, burgeoning Glebsigan society reached for technological innovation and spiritual enlightenment throughout the centuries that followed.\n\nA sedentary and enduring species, the Glebsigi have perhaps by necessity developed a complex yet highly effective bureaucratic apparatus for dealing with the intricacies of managing a globally unified society. Additionally, their lack of natural predators on Ladnah has led the Glebsigi to exist in a state of permanently optimistic curiosity regarding other lifeforms.\n\nHaving established a firm societal foundation on Ladnah using a mixture of spiritual doctrine and careful organization, the Glebsigi now once more raise their sight-organs to what lies beyond."

Even in some cases, the dragon would try to communicate with the dragon. Company cooperation. As a result, Tanson Company expanded its business scope and finally brought another chaotic order to the world.\n\nNow that the company's assets have reached the limit that a single planet can hold, Tanson's footsteps will not stop until the assets are all over the galaxy."

It is said that when Brehkk first gazed into the crystals' scintillating depths, the Khennet were - as one - granted their sentience.\n\nGenerations of prophets and archdruids have guided their people to seek meaning in their surrounding geology, as well as in the facets of their own, lucid bodies. Whatever is glimpsed is kept, in lore and in script.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_pasharti_desc:0 "The result of dark experimentation by the Jeferians - the former owners of the planet Taralon - the Pashartians are the ultimate parasites. Originally a semi-sapient creature dwelling in the depths of Taralon's mountains, the Jeferians uplifted and augmented them to act as a subservient slave race. However, their uplifting was rather too effective, and they unleashed a monster. Horrified at the capabilities of their creation - which included the ability to absorb other sentient species and turn them into Pashartians - the Jeferians tried to shut down the experiment. However, a small group of uplifted Pashartians escaped.\n\nOver the years, they bided their time, managing not only to evade capture, but also gradually increase their numbers and develop a technological base to rival the Jeferians. Eventually, the Jeferians noticed that something was amiss, but by then they were powerless to resist.\n\nSoon the Pashartians had seized control of the planet, unleashing violent pogroms on their erstwhile oppressors - all the while further increasing their numbers. Now poised to take to the stars, the Pashartians stand ready to pursue what they see as their solemn duty - the conversion of all lesser life forms to their likeness."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_sathyrel_desc:0 "It is an old lesson in Sathyrelian society that abundance and ease do not equal prosperity.\n\nThe overindulgence and sloth of our forebears eventually gave rise to an ethos of 'responsible hedonism': a way to ensure a sustainable future while still getting the most out of life. After all, food tastes better after physical labor, and an occupied mind has less time to pine for what is lacking.\n\nThe benefits of this ethos have since been readily apparent. With the clearer waters and minds afforded by our endeavors into space, life is that much sweeter. We've made great technological strides, and - though it may often be taken for granted - all Sathyrelians today retain their capacity for propulsion without swimming aids. Things are looking up."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_reselian_desc:0 "From master Mohist's thought of \"love together\" to mentor Karl Friedrich's solidaritism, the lacerian civilization has been developing in revolution and struggle. The \"red boat conference\" decades ago officially announced the establishment of the revolutionary fleet. The revolutionaries adopted the highest revolutionary program and declared war on all tyrants who threatened the development of civilization. After arduous struggle, the lacerian civilization has gained the most comprehensive and profound liberation in thousands of years and set its eyes on a broader deep space. It is believed that more civilizations have not yet broken free from the shackles of exploitation, and the Star Liberation Front will be the vanguard of the revolution and bring real equality and liberation to the stars."

War, tyranny, and a more unstable than usual climate combined to forge a species which is very adept at making the best of a bad situation.\n\nUntil only a few decades ago, low-scale conflict between a plurality of Gorthikan states was an ever-present state of affairs. As their civilization rapidly but uncomfortably progressed into the age of high technology, an underworld developed where regular Gorthikans would scavenge for a living and even splice in dangerous home brew gene cocktails in the search for a competitive advantage.\n\nIt is from that underworld that change came. Although cutthroat, it was far more egalitarian than Gorthikan high society - after all, everyone knew that fortune today could precede misfortune tomorrow. So when the idea of popular governance emerged, it rapidly took hold, spreading like wildfire. Before long, tyranny was overthrown and a \"Gorthikan Alliance\" of local constituencies was established.\n\nThough many were skeptical in the early years, unity was forged through purpose: suddenly, with Gorthikans no longer struggling for survival, the very stars appeared attainable. Now, with the discovery of the hyperlane network, a new chapter in their history may begin."

In order to pursue The leaving of The Toxic God, people have developed miracles that can cross the sea of stars.

Looking to harness the power of the God, the king created an order of knights dedicated to searching for the God wherever it may be. Centuries have passed and that quest has become the main pillar in Rototavuul society.\n\nAlong with the quest and the knights, feudalism has persisted as a proven political structure, and if it worked on one planet, why could it not be expanded to a galaxy?
